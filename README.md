# Caesar Cipher

This project, developed during the first year of university (2018/19) as part of the "Computers Programming" course, implements the Julius Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features:

  •  Encryption and decryption of text using the Julius Caesar Cipher
  
  •  File handling to read and write encrypted/decrypted text
  
  •  User-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction

## How to Use:

  •  Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt text.
  
  •  Enter the encryption/decryption key (shift value).
  
  •  Provide the input text or specify a file for processing.
  
  •  View the results in the console and check the generated output files.
